# Components

Components in Fubam provide **reusable UI building blocks** that can be shared across multiple templates and layouts.
They help maintain **modularity** and **clean structure** by encapsulating repeated interface elements into standalone units.

Unlike layouts (which define overall page structure), components are **self-contained pieces of UI** such as cards, buttons, navbars, or banners.

---

## 1. Component Folder Structure

It’s recommended to organize components in a separate folder:

```
Templates/
├── components/
│   └── card.pmx
├── layouts/
│   └── base.pmx
└── pages/
    └── home.pmx
```

* `components/` contains all reusable UI blocks
* `layouts/` contains page structures
* `pages/` contains templates that use layouts and components

---

## 2. Creating a Component

A component is a `.pmx` file that defines a **reusable UI structure**.

**Example: `card.pmx`**

```python
# Templates/components/card.pmx

Export = wrapper(
    div(
        h3(title if "title" in globals() else "Default Title"),
        p(description if "description" in globals() else "Default description"),
        className="card"
    )
)
```

**Notes:**

* Components can access variables passed from the page
* You can define fallback defaults using Python logic
* `wrapper()` binds multiple tags together (similar to JSX fragments `<> </>`)
* Components should remain focused and reusable

---

## 3. Using a Component in a Page

You can render a component inside a page template:

**Example: `home.pmx`**

```python
# Templates/pages/home.pmx

Export = HTML(
    h2("Featured Section"),
    useComponent("card.pmx",
        title="Fubam Engine",
        description="A lightweight functions-based templating system."
    )
)
```

* `useComponent("card.pmx", ...)` renders the component
* Passed arguments become accessible inside the component
* The returned HTML becomes part of the page output

---

## 4. Passing Dynamic Variables

Components can receive dynamic values from Python logic:

```python
user_name = "Aman"

Export = HTML(
    useComponent("card.pmx",
        title=f"Welcome, {user_name}",
        description="Glad to see you here."
    )
)
```

* Variables defined in the page are passed into the component
* This allows dynamic and data-driven UI composition
* Encourages reusable and flexible interface blocks

---

## 5. Using Components Inside Layouts

Components can also be used within layouts:

```python
# Templates/layouts/base.pmx

Export = HTML(
    header(
        useComponent("navbar.pmx")
    ),
    main(__content__),
    footer(
        useComponent("footer.pmx")
    )
)
```

* Components help keep layouts clean and modular
* Common elements like navigation and footers should be components
* This promotes separation of concerns

---

## 6. Best Practices

* Keep components **small and focused**
* Avoid embedding heavy page logic inside components
* Use clear and descriptive variable names
* Organize components in `Templates/components/`
* Prefer **composition over duplication**

---

## Summary

* Components define **reusable UI blocks**
* They accept variables (similar to props)
* They can be used in pages and layouts
* They improve **modularity** and **maintainability**
* They reinforce Fubam’s **function-based paradigm**
