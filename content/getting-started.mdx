# Getting Started

Once Fubam is installed, you can render your first template in just a few steps.
This section shows the correct workflow: creating a Fubam instance, writing a `.pmx` file (pure Python), and generating clean HTML output.

---

## **1. Create an Instance**

Fubam assumes a default template directory, but you can explicitly define your own:

```python
from fubam import Fubam

compiler = Fubam(templates_dir="Templates")
```

This tells Fubam where to search for your `.pmx` template files.

---

## **2. Create Your First Template**

Inside the directory you specified (`Templates`), create:

```
Templates/home.pmx
```

### **How `.pmx` Templates Work**

A `.pmx` file is **pure Python**, executed inside a special environment where HTML tags are available as Python functions (`div()`, `h1()`, `p()`, etc).

Each template must define an **Export** variable — this becomes the final HTML output.

Example template:

```python
# Templates/home.pmx

Export = HTML(
    h1("Hello, World!"),
    p("This page was generated with Fubam.")
)
```

You can use any real Python here — variables, loops, functions, conditions.

---

## **3. Render the Template**

Use the compiler instance to render the file.
The `resources` argument is optional and allows you to pass variables into the template.

```python
html = compiler.renderTemplate("home.pmx", resources={
    "name": "Aman"
})
```

### **Note on Output**

`Fubam().renderTemplate()` always returns a **plain string** containing the final HTML.
You can use this string with **any Python server or framework** — Flask, FastAPI, Django responses, custom servers, or static file generation.

Example:

```python
html = compiler.renderTemplate("home.pmx")
```

You can now:

* return it in a Flask route
* send it in a FastAPI response
* write it to a file
* embed it in any backend system
* use it inside CI pipelines or static-site generators

---


## **4. Save or Use the HTML Output**

To save the generated HTML as a static file:

```python
with open("home.html", "w") as f:
    f.write(html)
```

Your `home.html` is now ready to open in any browser.

## **5. What’s Next?**

Now that you’ve rendered your first page, explore the core features of Fubam:

* **Layouts** — define a shared base structure for all pages
* **Components** — write reusable UI blocks as Python functions
* **SEO Injection** — automatically insert `<meta>` tags
* **Asset Injection** — optionally inline CSS/JS for faster loads
