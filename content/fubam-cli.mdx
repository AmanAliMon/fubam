# CLI

The Fubam CLI provides a simple command-line interface for managing projects, building templates, and running development environments.

It is designed to keep workflows **minimal**, **fast**, and fully aligned with Fubam’s lightweight philosophy.

The CLI helps automate common tasks such as project initialization, rendering templates, and exporting optimized output.

---

## 1. Installation

If Fubam is installed via pip, the CLI becomes available automatically:

```bash
pip install fubam
```

Verify installation:

```bash
fubam --version
```

If installed correctly, the current version will be displayed.

---

## 2. Initialize a Project

Create a new Fubam project:

```bash
fubam init my-project
```

This generates a recommended project structure:

```
my-project/
├── Templates/
│   ├── layouts/
│   ├── components/
│   └── pages/
├── static/
└── fubam.config.py
```

* `Templates/` contains `.pmx` files
* `static/` stores assets (CSS, JS, images)
* `fubam.config.py` holds project configuration

---

## 3. Run Development Server

Start the development environment:

```bash
fubam serve
```

* Launches a local development server
* Automatically renders templates
* Enables rapid prototyping
* Designed for small-scale development and testing

By default, the server runs at:

```
http://localhost:8000
```

---

## 4. Build / Export Project

To generate optimized static output:

```bash
fubam build
```

This will:

* Render all templates
* Apply optimization steps
* Inject SEO enhancements
* Minify assets (if enabled)
* Export final HTML files

The output is typically generated in:

```
dist/
```

---

## 5. Configuration Options

You can customize CLI behavior inside `fubam.config.py`.

Example configuration:

```python
DEBUG = True
MINIFY = True
INLINE_ASSETS = False
OUTPUT_DIR = "dist"
```

Configuration allows control over:

* Debug mode
* Optimization pipeline
* Asset handling
* Export directory

---

## 6. Common Commands

```
fubam init <project-name>   # Create new project
fubam serve                 # Start development server
fubam build                 # Export optimized output
fubam --version             # Show current version
fubam help                  # Display available commands
```

---

## 7. Best Practices

* Use `serve` during development
* Use `build` for production export
* Keep configuration minimal
* Organize templates clearly before building
* Enable optimization flags for production

---

## Summary

* The Fubam CLI simplifies project management
* Supports initialization, development, and export
* Aligns with Fubam’s lightweight philosophy
* Automates rendering and optimization workflows
